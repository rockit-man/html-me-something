      <h1>"My Mother, The Real Lunatic"</h1>

		<p2>I will never forget the time my mom met a famous rapper, but I didn't. For real.</p2>

		<h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2>

		<p>It's not very often you cross paths with someone who has newly entered public notoriety. The individual I'm referring to is none other than Murphy Lee, a Hip-Hop artist from the early 2000s familial to anyone who has heard of or is a fan of  St. Louis hometown hero Nelly.</p>

		<p>During Nelly's meteoric rise to prominence in the early 2000s, his prestige gave way to Lee, a fledgling emcee from the neighborhood who was creating his own lane thanks to his Midwestern chill and lyrical prowess on the mic. Lee was one of several members of the St. Lunatics, a St. Louis Hip-Hop collective closely associated with Nelly. Lee's star was on the rise shortly after being featured on the Bad Boys II soundtrack alongside Diddy & Nelly.  Back home in St. Louis, he was all the rage. A cool guy possessing a cool demeanor with lyrics and bars to match.</p>

			<p>Since the release of his debut album "Country Grammar" in 2000, Nelly and The Lunatics were on my radar, as well as every other Hip-Hop fan in the city and beyond. Everyone around me in my hometown seemed to claim Nelly as family or next of kin. The running joke in St. Louis is that everyone who grew up in the city claims to be Nelly's cousin. It's funny, but it's also telling of how much influence he held within the city he called home. But this story isn't about Nelly. It's about Murphy Lee. And how I almost met him. Almost.</p>

		<h2>Let Me Explain</h2>

		<p>During my adolescence, shopping with my mother was a common occurrence, like so many of us. Looking back on those shopping trips, I can recognize there were several factors at play that seemed to characterize the various dynamics between parent and child amid frenzied retail experiences with two young children. My mother, as a single parent, had her mind on the budget. My little brother and I had fun and procurement on our minds. How that all panned out was determined by the household income surplus and our ability to behave ourselves before and during the trip into the store. To be certain, it was always a tug of war of sorts, but it taught me to be appreciative of my mother and to have gratitude for what I've been blessed with.</p>

		<p>There was one particular shopping trip that brought us to a Wal-Mart location outside of our usual haunt.  In St. Louis, particularly in North Saint Louis County, there aren't very many Wal-Mart locations to choose from and the location of Wal-Mart you choose to shop at is typically determined by your preferred shopping experience. In all honesty, that's just a very PC way of saying that certain demographics shopped at certain store locations, to put it bluntly. The Wal-Mart we usually shopped at had a rather interesting assortment of shoppers and it was always severely crowded and overrun with movement. Not to mention, there was a slight criminal element in the neighborhood that sometimes targeted the shoppers. My mother made the decision to switch it up and selected a different location to shop at. The one she chose was located in St. Charles, a more suburban locale with shiny new commercial development and a more sparse crowd.</p>

		<h2>Wal-Mart is a Trip</h2>

		<p>The shopping trip itself was worlds apart from what we had grown accustomed to witnessing at the famous big box store. Shelves were stocked. Displays were neatly organized. The voices of the shoppers didn't overtake the speaker system. The vibe was chill and stark in contrast to what we had attributed to shopping at the big blue supercenter. During the trip, my brother and I journeyed toward the electronics department ahead of our mother, which was the norm for us, and many other children, I suppose. While there, we noticed a man that looked very familiar. He was wearing dark sunglasses, had long dreadlocks nested underneath his fitted Cardinals ballcap, rocking clean white Air Force 1s, sauntering about with a paced and swaggered walk.</p>

		<p>I tapped my brother on the shoulder, "Is it just me or does that dude look just like Murphy Lee?" My little brother responded, "That does look like him. Let's tell Momma." We did exactly that, momentarily forgetting our mother's penchant for striking up conversations in public with total strangers. "I'm going to go up and ask him," she declared as she confidently strode her way towards Lee who appeared to be shopping with his young son. Without a word to each other, my brother and I quickly hid in a nearby aisle as to remove ourselves from whatever scene our mother was about to create.</p>

         <h2>Who's Mom Is This?</h2>

			<p>We, my brother and I, did not witness the exchange between the two up close, but my mother, who was expecting to see us standing right behind her, was completely shocked and embarrassed when she turned around to notice that her two sons had abandoned her in the presence of the famed lyricist. When the exchange was over and the two finally went their separate ways, we popped out on our mother who was still shocked and bewildered that her sons left her alone to shake hands with someone WE pointed out. "I can't believe y'all did me like that. You two ought to be ashamed. I was telling this man you two recognized him and I turn around and neither one of you were anywhere to be found. He probably thought I was a crazy woman pretending to have children. Don't ever do that to me again!" Which all fell on deaf ears because my brother and I could not stop laughing. And we still laugh about it to this day, even though more than likely the joke is really on us, her little lunatics.</p>
